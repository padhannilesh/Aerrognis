        <h1>Health Monitoring System</h1>
        <p>An air quality monitoring system is a network of sensors and instruments that measure various pollutants and particulate matter in the air. These systems provide real-time data on air quality, helping to identify pollution sources and assess the health risks associated with poor air quality.</p>
        
        <p>Poor air quality, characterized by high levels of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3), can have serious health effects. Short-term exposure can cause respiratory issues, exacerbate asthma and other lung conditions, and lead to cardiovascular problems. Long-term exposure has been linked to lung cancer, heart disease, and even premature death.</p>
        
        <p>Monitoring air quality based on gas levels involves deploying sensors that detect and measure the concentration of specific gases in the atmosphere. These sensors can be stationary, mobile, or even wearable, and they transmit data to central databases or platforms for analysis and dissemination. By monitoring gas levels, authorities and individuals can take appropriate actions to mitigate pollution, such as reducing emissions from vehicles and industrial sources, implementing clean energy solutions, and promoting public awareness and behavior changes.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, air quality monitoring systems play a crucial role in protecting public health by providing timely information to policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public, enabling informed decision-making and proactive measures to reduce air pollution and its harmful effects.</p>
